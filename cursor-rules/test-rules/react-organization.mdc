<title>React Component Organization</title>

<rules>
- Keep React components under 200 lines
- Extract custom hooks to separate files in a `hooks/` directory
- Name hook files as `use{HookName}.ts` or `use{HookName}.tsx`
- Colocate test files with components using `.test.tsx` or `.spec.tsx` suffix
- Place test files in the same directory as the component they test
- When a component exceeds 150 lines, consider extracting sub-components
- Group related components in feature-based directories
- Export hooks from an index file for cleaner imports
</rules>

<example type="good">
```
src/
  components/
    UserProfile/
      UserProfile.tsx         (< 200 lines)
      UserProfile.test.tsx    (colocated test)
      UserAvatar.tsx         (extracted sub-component)
      hooks/
        useUserData.ts       (extracted custom hook)
        index.ts             (exports all hooks)
```
