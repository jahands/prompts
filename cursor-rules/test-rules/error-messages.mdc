Error while trying to install dependencies for your React project:

npm ERR! code ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall open
npm ERR! path /Users/john/project/package.json

This error occurred because npm couldn't find a package.json file in your project directory.

To fix this:
1. Make sure you're in the correct project directory
2. If this is a new project, run: npm init -y
3. If package.json exists elsewhere, navigate to that directory first
```

fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

- Then add your files: git add .
- Finally create your commit: git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
