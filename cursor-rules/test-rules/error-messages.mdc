<title>Error Messages with Context and Fixes</title>

<rules>
- Always include what the user was trying to accomplish when an error occurs
- Provide the specific error details and why it happened
- Suggest at least one actionable fix or next step
- Reference the exact location (file, line, function) where applicable
- Use clear language avoiding technical jargon unless necessary
- Format error messages consistently with context → error → suggestion structure
</rules>

<examples>
<example type="good">
```
Error: Failed to save user preferences
Context: You were trying to update notification settings
Problem: The database connection timed out after 30 seconds
Fix: Try again in a few moments, or check your network connection
```
</example>

<example type="good">
```typescript
// When catching errors in code
try {
  await updateUserProfile(data);
} catch (error) {
  throw new Error(
    `Failed to update profile with email "${data.email}". ` +
    `Database returned: ${error.message}. ` +
    `Please verify the email format and try again.`
  );
}
```
