Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

While trying to display user information, the code attempted to access a 'name' property on an undefined user object at line 42 in UserProfile.tsx.

Suggested fix: Add a null check before accessing the property:
if (user && user.name) {
  return <h1>{user.name}</h1>;
}

This error likely occurred because the user data hasn't loaded yet or the API returned null.
