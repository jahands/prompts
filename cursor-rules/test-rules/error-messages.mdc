Error: Failed to connect to database while trying to fetch user profile.

What went wrong: The PostgreSQL connection timed out after 30 seconds.

Suggested fixes:
1. Check if PostgreSQL is running: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`
2. Verify your connection settings in `.env`:
   - DATABASE_HOST should be 'localhost' or your server IP
   - DATABASE_PORT should be 5432 (default)
3. Test the connection manually: `psql -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database`
```
