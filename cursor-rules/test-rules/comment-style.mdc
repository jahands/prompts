<title>Comment Style - Explain Why, Not What</title>

<rules>
- Avoid comments that describe what the code does
- Write comments that explain why decisions were made
- Document business logic, edge cases, and non-obvious behavior
- Skip comments for self-explanatory code
- Focus on intent, context, and reasoning
</rules>

<examples>
<example type="good">
```javascript
// We process payments before shipping to ensure funds are available
// and reduce chargebacks from fraudulent orders
await processPayment(order);
await shipOrder(order);

// Using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
// during high traffic periods (see incident #4521)
const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000;

// Customer requested this specific format for legacy system compatibility
return date.format('MM/DD/YYYY');
```
</example>

<example type="bad">
```javascript
// Increment counter
counter++;

// Check if user is logged in
if (user.isLoggedIn) {
  // Call the API
  await api.fetchData();
}

// Set name to John
user.name = 'John';
```
