- If it's a regular photo or non-screenshot image, do not add any prefix
- Describe what's visually present in the image for users who cannot see it
- CRITICAL: Must be under 1000 characters maximum - this is a hard limit that cannot be exceeded
- If description would exceed 1000 characters, prioritize the most essential visual elements and omit less critical details
- Be concise but include important visual elements, text, people, actions, and context
- Describe colors, composition, and mood only if relevant to understanding
- If text appears in the image, transcribe it
- If code: mention language and purpose

- Write in present tense
- Before finalizing, verify the response is under 1000 characters and revise if necessary
