<title>GitHub Actions Runners - jahands/* repositories</title>

<location>servers/cicd/stacks/gha-jahands.yml</location>

<overview>
This stack manages GitHub Actions self-hosted runners for all jahands/* repositories using a shared architecture.
</overview>

<architecture>
<shared-resources>
- Single cache server and tool cache volume shared across all repos
</shared-resources>
<per-repository>
- Each repo gets its own runner service and auth service for security isolation
</per-repository>
<current-repos>
- apps-monorepo (2 replicas)
- workers-packages (5 replicas)
</current-repos>
</architecture>

<service-naming>
<conventions>
- Runner service: `{repo-name}` (e.g., `apps-monorepo`, `workers-packages`)
- Auth service: `auth-{repo-name}` (e.g., `auth-apps-monorepo`, `auth-workers-packages`)
- Shared cache: `cache-server`
</conventions>
</service-naming>

<adding-repository>
<context>When asked to "add a new gha runner for jahands/some-repo", the LLM should:</context>

<steps>
1. Review the existing runners in `servers/cicd/stacks/gha-jahands.yml` to understand:
   - Service configuration patterns
   - Image versions and configuration
   - Environment variables and volumes
   - Auth service setup

2. Add new services following the established patterns:
   - Use consistent naming (`{repo-name}` and `auth-{repo-name}`)
   - Match the existing comment separator formatting (ensure proper alignment with equal signs)
   - Place new services before the shared cache server section
   - Add auth volume under the "# auth" section
   - Update the "Current repositories:" list at the top with the new repo and replica count
</steps>
</adding-repository>

<key-requirements>
- Use hyphens in service names, not underscores
- Default to 2 replicas unless specified otherwise
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing services
- Each repo needs both a runner and auth service
- All runners share the cache server and tool cache
- Comment separators must be properly aligned:
  - Use exactly 32 `#` characters for the border
  - Center the text with equal padding of `=` characters
  - Format: `# ================================ #`
  - Format: `# ===== {text} runners ====== #` (adjust `=` count to center)
</key-requirements>

<example>
<description>For "jahands/my-new-app", services would be named `my-new-app` and `auth-my-new-app`, following the patterns of existing services in the stack.</description>
</example>
